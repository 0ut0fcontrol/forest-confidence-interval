   ==========

   `duecredit <http://duecredit.org>`_  is a framework conceived to address the
   problem of inadequate citation of scientific software and methods. It automates
   the insertion of citations into code. We use it here to refer to the original
   publication introducing the method we have implemented.

   See  https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/blob/master/README.md for examples.
